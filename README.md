[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@journyio/http?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@journyio/http)

HTTP library that powers our [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/journy-io/js-sdk).

## üíæ Installation

You can use your package manager (`npm` or `yarn`) to install the HTTP utilities:

```bash
npm install --save @journyio/http
```
or
```bash
yarn add @journyio/http
```

## üîå Getting started

### HttpClientNode

Example of GET request:

```ts
import { HttpClientNode, HttpRequest, HttpHeaders } from "@journyio/http";
import { URL } from "url";

const client = new HttpClientNode(/* timeoutInMillis = */ 5000);

const response = await client.send(
  new HttpRequest(
    new URL(`https://api.domain/users?email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}`),
    "GET",
    new HttpHeaders({ "x-api-key": "my-api-key" })
  )
);

console.log(response.getStatusCode());
console.log(response.getBody());
console.log(response.getHeaders());
console.log(response.getHeaders().byName("x-ratelimit-remaining"));
console.log(response.getHeaders().byName("X-RateLimit-Remaining"));
```

Example of POST request:

```ts
const response = await client.send(
  new HttpRequest(
    new URL("https://api.domain/users"),
    "POST",
    new HttpHeaders({
      "x-api-key": "my-api-key",
      "content-type": "application/json",
    }),
    JSON.stringify({ email: "user@acme.com" })
  )
);
```

`HttpClientNode` doesn't support redirects yet.

## ü§îÔ∏è Why another HTTP client?

While [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) is great... It's not yet natively available in [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/19393). It's also missing an important feature: an interface.

```ts
interface HttpClient {
  send(request: HttpRequest): Promise<HttpResponse>;
}
```

Let's say you have an API client:

```ts
class API {
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    const response = await fetch(/* ... */);

    return await response.json();
  }
}
```

If we want to test this API client, we need to mock HTTP requests. It's really hard to do and often requires [magic](https://github.com/nock/nock).

By depending on an interface for an HTTP client we can make this a lot easier:

```ts
class API {
  constructor(private readonly httpClient: HttpClient) {}

  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    const response = await this.httpClient.send(
      new HttpRequest(/* ... */)
    );

    return JSON.parse(response.getBody());
  }
}
```

In our test we can use `HttpClientFixed`:

```ts
class HttpClientFixed implements HttpClient {
  private lastRequest: HttpRequest | undefined;

  constructor(private readonly response: HttpResponse) {}

  async send(request: HttpRequest): Promise<HttpResponse> {
    this.lastRequest = request;

    return this.response;
  }

  getLastRequest() {
    return this.lastRequest;
  }
}
```

Our test will look something like this:

```ts
test("our API client works", async () => {
  const http = new HttpClientFixed(
    new HttpResponse(
      200,
      new HttpHeaders({ "x-ratelimit-remaining": "200" }),
      '{"id":"id","name":"Hans"}'
    )
  );

  const api = new API(http);

  expect(await api.getUser("id")).toEqual({ id: "id", name: "Hans" });
  expect(http.getLastRequest()).toEqual(new HttpRequest(/* ... */));
})
```

In PHP world this concept is known as [PSR-18: HTTP Client](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/).

Of course, this makes only sense in TypeScript world. Interfaces are not available in JavaScript.

Apart from testing, there are more benefits...

We can log requests for debugging purposes:

```ts
class HttpClientConsoleLogging implements HttpClient {
  constructor(private readonly client: HttpClient) {}

  async send(request: HttpRequest) {
    console.log("Request...", request.getMethod(), request.getURL().toString());
    const response = await this.client.send(request);
    console.log("Response...", response.getStatusCode(), response.getBody());

    return response;
  }
}
```

```ts
const http = new HttpClientConsoleLogging(
  new HttpClientNode()
);

const api = new API(http);

// Request and response will be logged to the console...
await api.getUser("id");
```

More ideas (not included in this package):
- Store requests (and responses) of calls that failed
- Keep track of rate limits
- Add credentials to requests
- ...

## üíØ Tests
